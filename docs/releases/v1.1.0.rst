1.1.0 release notes
===================

New features
------------

* Show list of all URLs cached in the Wagtail Admin.

* Support purging individual URLs (via regular expressions) from the cache. See
  :ref:`purge_specific_urls`.

* Ignore tracking querystring parameters by default. This means that pages with
  unique tracking parameters will still be cached and/or served from the cache
  regardless of those parameters. This should massively improve performance on
  sites with heavy marketing activity, but can potentially introduce breakage if
  you have server-side logic that uses tracking codes via the querystring.

  The list of querystrings to ignore can be customized, or the feature can be
  completely disabled. See Django setting :ref:`WAGTAIL_CACHE_IGNORE_QS`.


Bug fixes
---------

* Previously, request with methods except GET and HEAD were never cached, even
  if you override the caching decision with ``is_request_cacheable`` hooks.
  These requests are still not cached by default, but *can be cached* if you
  override the caching decision. Please use caution when overriding caching
  decisions using :doc:`these hooks </getting_started/hooks>`.


Maintenance
-----------

* Add support for Django 4.

* Supports Wagtail 2 only.

* New shiny documentation based on the Wagtail Sphinx theme.
